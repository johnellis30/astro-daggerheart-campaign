# AI Generated Content

This folder contains all newly generated content from the Campaign AI Agent. 

## Purpose

All AI-generated content is saved here first for **manual review and organization** before being moved to the appropriate campaign folders.

## Workflow

1. **Generate**: AI creates content and saves it here
2. **Review**: Check the generated content for quality and accuracy
3. **Edit**: Make any necessary adjustments
4. **Move**: Move the file to the appropriate folder:
   - Characters → `src/content/characters/`
   - Locations → `src/content/locations/` 
   - Adventures → `src/content/adventures/`
   - Monsters → `src/content/monsters/`
   - Items → `src/content/items/`
   - Environments → `src/content/environments/`
   - Campaign lore → `src/content/campaign/`

## File Naming Convention

Generated files follow this pattern:
- `{TYPE}_{DATE}_{TIME}_AI_GENERATED.md`
- Example: `CHARACTER_20250816_142330_AI_GENERATED.md`

## Tips

- The AI agent will suggest the destination folder for each generated file
- Review content for consistency with your campaign world
- Feel free to edit and customize the generated content before moving it
- Delete any files you don't want to keep

## Moving Files

You can use the suggested move commands printed by the AI agent, or simply drag and drop files to the appropriate folders.
