# Silverstream River
*Campaign Environment*

# Environment: Silverstream River - Magical Surge

**Description:** A swift-moving river, now surging with raw, unpredictable magical energy due to the theft of the Tear of the Moon. The air crackles, and the water glows with an eerie light.

**Tier:** 1

**Type:** Traversal

**Difficulty:** 12

**Impulses:**

*   Bar crossing
*   Carry away the unready
*   Divide the land
*   Unleash wild magic

**Potential Adversaries:** Razorclaw Otters (mutated by the magic), Water Weirds (improvised, magically-charged), Jagged Knife Bandits (taking advantage of the chaos)

**Features:**

*   **Unpredictable Currents:** (Passive) Crossing the river requires a Progress Countdown (4). Each failed progress roll triggers a random Magical Surge effect.
    * Which characters have a strong reason to risk crossing? What methods do they try?

*   **Chaotic Waters:** (Passive) The water glows with raw power, making it difficult to see what lies beneath. Increase Difficulty of Perception and Investigation checks related to the river by 2.

*   **Patient Hunter:** (Action, 1 Fear) Summon a magically-infused aquatic predator (e.g., Glass Snake, mutated fish). On a successful attack, the predator also inflicts a random Magical Surge effect (see below).
    * Does the predator seem drawn to a particular PC? Does it exhibit signs of increased intelligence or awareness?

*   **Tear-Touched Zone:** (Reaction) Whenever a creature comes into contact with the river's water, roll 1d6:
    *   1-3: No effect.
    *   4-5: Minor Magical Surge (roll on the Minor Surge Table).
    *   6: Major Magical Surge (roll on the Major Surge Table).

**Magical Surge Tables:**

*   **Minor Surge (1d6):**
    1.  Brief levitation (1 range band).
    2.  Skin turns iridescent for 1d4 rounds.
    3.  Object nearby animates (harmlessly).
    4.  A burst of light stuns the target for 1 action.
    5.  The target is covered in bubbles.
    6.  Strong magical smell.

*   **Major Surge (1d6):**
    1.  The target is teleported to a random location within Far range (reroll if unreachable).
    2.  A spectral copy of the target appears nearby, mimicking their actions for 1d4 rounds.
    3.  The target gains resistance to one damage type (random) for 1d4 rounds.
    4.  All creatures within Close range are momentarily blinded (Agility Reaction Roll 12 to avoid).
    5.  A geyser of water erupts from the river, dealing 1d6+2 physical damage to creatures in Very Close range.
    6.  The target's shadow comes to life for 1 round before vanishing.

**GM Notes:**
What were some of the events

This revised stat block provides clear guidelines for the effects of the Silverstream's magical surge, offering both minor and major complications for the PCs to face.

Is this stat block more in line with what you envisioned?
