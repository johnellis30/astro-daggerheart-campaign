# Atherian Steppes
*Campaign Environment*

# Environment: Atherian Steppes

**Description:** A vast expanse of open plains, characterized by tall grasses, rolling hills, and scattered rock formations. The sun beats down relentlessly, and water is scarce.

**Tier:** 1

**Type:** Traversal

**Difficulty:** 10 (Base for Stamina checks)

**Impulses:**

*   Test endurance
*   Expose travelers to danger
*   Reveal glimpses of civilization
*   Offer false hope of shelter

**Features:**

*   **Relentless Sun:** (Passive) During daylight hours, characters must make a Stamina check (Difficulty 10) each hour or suffer 1 Stress from heat exhaustion.
    *   *What measures do the PCs take to protect themselves from the sun? Does anyone have relevant skills or equipment (e.g., Survival, herbalism knowledge, waterskin)?*

*   **Scorched Earth:** (Action, 1 Fear) A brushfire erupts in a 15 ft radius, burning away any non-magical protection.
     * What is the wind direction.

*   **Wind's Warning:** (Reaction) The winds carry eerie whispers, hinting at danger ahead. The GM describes the danger (e.g., "You hear a faint cry for help," "The wind carries the scent of smoke").
    If the character does not, they do not act and can not take the initiative.
* It is very hard to succeed and there is the risk of failure, which can cause issues.

*   What details about the current area might the wind reveal? How do the PCs interpret the warning?

**Notes:**

*   The difficulty of the "Relentless Sun" Stamina check can be modified based on the availability of water and shade. If the PCs secure adequate supplies or find a sheltered location, reduce the Difficulty.
*   The "Wind's Warning" feature can be used to foreshadow encounters, traps, or plot developments in later acts.

Is this an improvement? I'm focusing on making these features more actionable and meaningful for you as the GM.
