In the sprawling lands of the Atherian Empire and beyond, the divine influence of Adonalsium permeates every aspect of life, faith, and magic. Among the myriad of beliefs, ten religious sects stand out, each under the guidance of an ancient dragon whose power and wisdom are rivalled only by their mysterious connection to the world's essence. These dragons, unlike the chromatic and metallic beings of legend, embody the ethereal qualities of the shards themselves, guiding their followers in pursuits of balance, destruction, creation, and more.
