# WELCOME TO YOLEN: A DAGGERHEART CAMPAIGN PRIMER

## The World

You are on Yolen, a planet simmering with tension. The continent of Eldoria is home to two major powers: the human-led Atheria and the elven Sylvani.

## The Factions

*   **Atheria**: A powerful empire that values Stability, Advancement, and Influence. They believe in order, progress, and the rule of law.
*   **Sylvani**: A kingdom deeply connected to the natural world, valuing Freedom, Harmony, and Preservation. They believe in living in balance with nature and respecting ancient traditions.

## The Conflict

For generations, Atheria and Sylvani have been uneasy neighbors. Now, simmering tensions threaten to erupt into open war, threatening to consume the entire continent. Each faction is preparing, but have yet to draw first blood.

## The Starting Point

You begin your journey in Riverbend, a region caught between Atheria and Sylvani. The people of Riverbend are diverse, with humans and elves living alongside one another. Riverbend is known for its unique position along the Silverstream River, providing an abundance of life and wonder to the land.

*   **Ancestries:** Human, Elf, Dwarf, Goblin, Halfling, Orc, Clank, Drakona, Faerie, Faun, Firbolg, Fungril, Galapa, Giant, Infernis, Katari, Ribbet, Simiah

## Your Role

You can choose to be anyone from any background on Yolen. We will all create together! As you all have decided to stay in Riverbend, it is up to you on how to pursue your goals. What you do, will impact the outcome of the world, so choose wisely!
