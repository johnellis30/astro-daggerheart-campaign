# Campaign Overview
*Campaign Information*

#main_plot
# Shadows of the Ancient Dawn

I like option 1. Give me this ending, but this is now going to redefine the next 3 subacts. So give me an outline for those too. Below is some additional context for the world the PCs find themselves in.

**A Daggerheart Campaign Setting**

**Concept:** On pre-shattering Yolen, war brews between a human empire and an elven kingdom, while whispers of forgotten civilizations and ancient powers stir beneath the surface.

**Logline:** As war consumes all that the PCs know, it is their job to discover whether it should, and what the future might look like.

**Campaign Description:**

>For generations, the human-led Empire of Atheria and the elven Kingdom of Sylvani have stood as uneasy neighbors on the continent of Eldoria, on the planet Yolen. Now, long-simmering tensions have erupted into open war. The Atherian Empire, striving for **Stability, Advancement, and Influence,** seeks to bring its vision of a prosperous and secure future to the land. The Sylvani Kingdom, guided by Freedom, Harmony, and Preservation, fights to protect its ancient traditions and the delicate balance of the natural world.
>
>You begin your journey in Riverbend, a region caught between these two mighty powers. As the war escalates, you find yourselves embroiled in a conflict that reaches far beyond simple territorial disputes. Whispers of forgotten civilizations and powerful energies stirring beneath the surface hint at a deeper mystery, one that could reshape the fate of Eldoria forever.
>
>Will you rise to defend the ideals you hold dear? Will you navigate the treacherous currents of war and uncover the secrets of the ancient past? The choices you make will determine the future of this land, and perhaps, awaken something that was meant to stay sleeping.
