In the vast lands of the Atherian Empire, the divine presence of Adonalsium is a central pillar of spiritual and daily life. However, the monolithic view of this deity fractures into a kaleidoscope of faiths, each reflecting a different aspect of Adonalsium's complex nature. These sects, while united in their reverence for the god, diverge in rituals, beliefs, and interpretations, mirroring the eventual fragmentation of Adonalsium into various Shards. Here, we delve into the rich tapestry of religions venerating Adonalsium in their unique ways, providing a deep well of cultural and narrative depth for adventures within the Atherian Empire.

**Rituals:** Ceremonies often involve the creation of art or the planting of new life. Their temples are adorned with intricate murals and sculptures, and holy days are marked by festivals of creation where citizens are encouraged to produce something, be it a poem, a crafted item, or a planted seed.
