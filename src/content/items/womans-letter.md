# Document: The Woman's Letter

**Description:** A draft of a letter, seemingly never sent. Written in elegant but frantic Sylvani script on a small piece of parchment.

**Content:**

>To Dearest Sister,
>
>I write this knowing the risks. I can no longer reconcile what I believed to be true with what I have witnessed. Our purpose, as guided by **The Winnow**, was to bring balance, but now I am not so certain. My silence has become unbearable.
>
>I can not speak of specifics here. Just know that the ends do not justify the means. The path we walk has grown too dark. The light of goodness does not flow on that path.
>
>I seek counsel, guidance from wise and trusted souls, before making my final choice. Should I not arrive, know that I tried to be true, and that the darkness consumes all. I could not go on being a pawn.

**Note:**

*   The letter's tone is desperate and conflicted, suggesting a growing disillusionment with The Winnow's methods.
*   The woman never finished the letter.
