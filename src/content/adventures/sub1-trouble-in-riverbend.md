*Act 1, Sub-Act 1 • Campaign Adventure*

## Adventure Overview

The tranquil valley of Riverbend faces a crisis when the sacred Tear of the Moon crystal is stolen from its shrine. This magical artifact has maintained the balance of the Silverstream River for generations, and its absence threatens both the natural harmony and the political stability of the region.

## Starting Scene

### The Call for Help
The player characters find themselves in Riverbend when **Elara Meadowlight**, the respected Sylvani village elder, approaches them with urgent desperation in her ancient eyes. The Tear of the Moon—a crystal that regulates the magical energies flowing through the Silverstream River—has been stolen from its sacred shrine.

*"The waters grow dark, and the magic falters,"* Elara explains. *"Without the Tear, our valley faces ruin. Will you help us recover what has been taken?"*
