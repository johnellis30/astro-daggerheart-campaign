# Sub1 Side Quest River Secret
*Campaign Adventure*

# Act 1, Sub-Act 1: The River's Secret (Side Quest)

**Hook:** Amidst the chaos in Riverbend, a keen observer might notice something unusual amidst the turbulent waters of the Silverstream River (Perception Check 12). A figure bobs listlessly downstream, caught in a tangle of branches and glowing algae. Closer inspection reveals it to be:

* A Body: The corpse of a young woman, her face pale and still in the glowing river water. She's dressed in simple, travel-worn clothes. Her hands are bound with coarse rope, and a gag is tied tightly around her mouth. The body is stiff and cold. An Insight check will show signs of long term abuse.

**Objective:** Uncover the identity of the dead woman, the circumstances surrounding her death, and the meaning of a cryptic letter found on her person, all while being pressed to stop the theft of Elara.

**Key Steps:**

1.  **Body Retrieval:** Safely recover the body from the turbulent river (Strength/Athletics check, Difficulty 12).

2.  **Examining the Corpse:** Careful examination reveals:

    *   **Time of Death:** The body is stiff, indicating that death occurred recently, during the surge of power from the stolen crystal. The currents of The Stream has washed away details.
    *   **Cause of Death:** A thin, almost invisible garrote wire is embedded in her neck, suggesting strangulation. A Medicine check (Difficulty 12) reveals that death likely occurred during the height of the energy surges, allowing the assailant to blend in with the chaos.

    *   **The Religious Markings:** A small tattoo depicting a stylized, broken circle is found on her wrist, partially obscured by the ropes.

3.  **Letter Discovery:** Find and translate the hidden letter, revealing the woman's doubts about The Winnow and their organization (See The Woman's Letter).

4.  **The Investigation - Tracking Faelan:**

* Interrogation with witnesses:
* Local Herbalist (Perhaps Linnea): She saw the woman near the river collecting ingredients. (Insight Check): She was acting strangely
         * Local Children: They saw someone fleeing the riverbank in the pre-dawn hours, matching the description of a respected member of the Sylvani community, Faelan Nightwood.

5. The Sylvani NPC FAELAN NIGHTWOOD must not know if you want to talk or want to look for more proof. 
* Faelan Nightwood: He does not want to be investigated.

6.  **The Culprit's Identity - Faelan Nightwood**:
    * This may cause issue if there is a PC with a Sylvani heritage.
 * The goal was not to have them know that they knew before his death. If they did everything right, they should come at the same time and have no opportunity to act.
* Trackdown or Confront

**Tragic Resolution:**
The PCs track down NPC FAELAN NIGHTWOOD back to his secluded home deep within the Sylvani Woods, but find him dead by suicide.

*   Faelan's Home: A modest dwelling built among the trees, blending seamlessly with the surrounding forest. The air is heavy with the scent of herbs and incense.

*   **Suicide Note:** A hastily written note, penned in Sylvani, lies on a nearby table. It expresses remorse and despair, but offers no clear explanation for the murder. Key phrases:
 * The world is too big, but what I did was right.
   * I'm the tool to help.

*   **The Lorekeeper:** On a shelf hidden amongst the herbs, the PCs find the Lorekeeper. Its presence suggests Faelan was actively researching or monitoring individuals connected to THE WINNOW.

Does this give you enough to help them put all the pieces together?
