# Sub2 Whispers From The Past
*Campaign Adventure*

# Act 1, Sub-Act 2: Whispers from the Past

**Overview:** The PCs leave Riverbend and face the rigors of the Atherian Steppes, navigating treacherous terrain and deceptive whispers to find Lyrian and uncover the truth.

**Starting Situation:** The PCs have gathered what information they can in Riverbend and are following the trail left by the Tear of the Moon thieves.

**Wind's Warning and the Hidden Hand**

- **Description:** As the PCs trek across the Atherian Steppes, the wind picks up, howling through the rocky terrain. The sun beats down relentlessly, creating shimmering mirages. They spot an inscription carved in elegant Sylvani script on a flat rock near the side of a large rock formation. A towering mesa, vaguely shaped like a hand, looms in the distance, challenging the interpretation of the text.
- **Inscription (in Sylvani):** _"When shadows dance and whispers lie, seek the Hidden Hand beneath the sky."_ (Requires Sylvani or Knowledge (Lore) check, Difficulty 12, to decipher.) The PC's must see their hand.

The PCs can see a mesa in the distance, but must recognize that it is shaped subtly like a hand. 

If they PCs follow the whispers, it leads them away from the mesa and into greater danger. 
**Consequences of Following the Whispers:**

- If the PCs choose to trust the whispers and ignore the mesa, they travel for several hours in the direction the wind seems to be urging them. The terrain becomes increasingly harsh and desolate, and they notice the following:
    - **False Oasis:** A shimmering mirage appears in the distance, promising water and shade. However, as they approach, it dissipates, leaving them even more dehydrated and demoralized (trigger Atherian Steppes "Relentless Sun" with disadvantage on the Stamina check).
    - **Growing Unease:** The whispers become more insistent and unsettling, filled with taunting voices and distorted images (Presence check, Difficulty 11, to resist marking a Stress from the psychological strain).
    - Encounter the Echoing Wraith

### Bandit Scout (Mesa Guard) Ambush
*   **Trigger:** The PCs approach a narrow canyon or hidden path leading towards the mesa's base.
*   **Description:** A lone Bandit Scout, tasked with guarding the approach, attempts to ambush the party. See ADVERSARY BANDIT SCOUT MESAGUARD for stats.
*   **Tactics:** The scout uses stealth and ranged attacks to harass the PCs, attempting to delay them 
### Hidden Spring Discovery
*   **Requirement:** After defeating the Bandit Scout or successfully navigating the area.
*   **Description:** The PCs discover a hidden spring, providing a much-needed source of water and a place to rest. The Bandit might reveal some information with the "Mesa Passphrase"
*   **Reward:** Replenishes water supplies; allows for a short rest.
*  **Find injured band** The PCs find the injured bandit left among a massacre of the other bandits who they think is responsible for the theft of The Tear of the Moon.
