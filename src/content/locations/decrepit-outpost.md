# Decrepit Outpost
*Campaign Location*

# Location: Decrepit Outpost

**Description:**

An unnamed and long-forgotten structure stands as a testament to a bygone era. The structure's purpose has been lost. Weather-beaten stone walls, crumbling archways, and overgrown vegetation hint at its age. The outpost commands a strategic view of the surrounding steppes, but its current state of disrepair renders it vulnerable.
