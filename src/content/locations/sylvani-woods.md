*Campaign Location*

# Location: Sylvani Woods

**Description:**

The Sylvani Woods occupy much of the center of Eldoria, a vast and ancient forest teeming with life and magic. The woods are the ancestral home of the Sylvani elves, who live in harmony with nature, their settlements blending seamlessly with the surrounding environment.

**Characteristics:**

* **Flora:** Towering trees with emerald canopies filter the sunlight, creating a dappled, ethereal atmosphere. The forest floor is carpeted with moss, ferns, and a variety of flowering plants. The air is filled with the scent of pine, damp earth, and wildflowers.
* **Fauna:** The Sylvani Woods are home to a diverse array of creatures, from elusive woodland creatures to magical beasts and spirits. Deer, wolves, bears, and other animals roam freely, while the trees are alive with the songs of countless birds.
* **Sylvani Presence:** The elves have a deep connection to the woods. They protect its natural beauty and resources. They blend structures within its structure
