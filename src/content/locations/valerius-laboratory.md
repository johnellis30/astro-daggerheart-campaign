# Valerius Laboratory
*Campaign Location*

# Location: Valerius's Hidden Laboratory

**Description:**

Hidden within the decrepit outpost, Valerius's laboratory is a makeshift workshop filled with arcane equipment, strange artifacts, and alchemical ingredients. The air crackles with residual energy from the Tear of the Moon, and the scent of ozone and exotic herbs hangs heavy in the air. The lab is dimly lit by flickering candles and strategically placed crystals.
