# Eldoria
*Campaign Location*

# Location: Eldoria

**Description:**

Eldoria: a continent where ancient forests whisper secrets to windswept plains, where rivers of liquid crystal carve paths through valleys of shimmering stone, and where the very air hums with untapped power. Beneath the emerald canopy of the Sylvani Woods, elusive creatures of myth and legend roam freely, their forms shifting with the dappled sunlight. To the east, the Atherian Steppes stretch out like a tapestry woven from gold and crimson, dotted with bustling cities and fortified outposts that stand as testaments to human ingenuity and ambition.

Across Eldoria, crumbling ruins and forgotten monuments stand as silent witnesses to ages long past. These relics of lost civilizations hold clues to the planet's dawn, when magic flowed freely and the veil between worlds was thin. But even as nature's wonders and the echoes of history beckon, a shadow looms large over Eldoria. The drums of war beat louder with each passing day, threatening to engulf this vibrant land in a conflict that could shatter the delicate balance between nature and civilization, between the ancient past and the uncertain future.
