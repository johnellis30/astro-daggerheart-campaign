*Campaign Character*

# NPC: Faelan Nightwood

**Description:** Former Follower of The Winnow, Now the Victim in "The River's Secret"

*Note:** This file contains spoilers for the River's Secret side quest. Only reveal this information to the GM.*

## Overview

*   **Identity:** Faelan Nightwood was a respected member of the Riverbend Sylvani community, known for his knowledge of ancient lore and his dedication to preserving the forest's traditions.
*   **Secret:** Unbeknownst to most, Faelan was secretly a former follower of The Winnow, a mysterious organization operating beneath the surface of Eldoria. 

## Role in "The River's Secret"

*   **The Murder:** Faelan murdered the woman, a fellow follower of The Winnow, because she expressed doubts about the organization's methods and threatened to expose their secrets. He acted during the chaos following the theft of the Tear of the Moon, hoping to conceal his crime.
*   **The Suicide:** When confronted with the evidence, Faelan takes his own life to protect The Winnow and prevent further investigation.

## Motivations

*   **Former Belief:** Faelan was initially drawn to The Winnow's promise of restoring balance to Eldoria and protecting the Sylvani way of life.
*   **Growing Doubts:** Over time, Faelan witnessed the organization's increasingly ruthless tactics and began to question their true motives. However, his loyalty and fear of retribution kept him from acting sooner.
*   **Fear and Despair:** The woman's murder drives Faelan to the edge of despair. He believes he is acting for the greater good, but the guilt consumes him. When it came to finding his own death, no one should know. He wanted to make sure that they did not tell anyone.

## Connections

* No one would have known.

## Possessions
