# Silverstream Serpent

*Campaign Adversary*

# ADVERSARY: Silverstream Serpent

**Description:**
The Silverstream Serpent is a massive, ancient creature that has claimed the depths of the Silverstream River as its domain. With scales that shimmer like liquid silver under the moonlight, this serpent is not only a sight to behold but also a formidable adversary. Its presence has been rumored for generations, but recent disturbances in the river's magical leylines have driven the serpent to surface more frequently, attacking boats and riverside settlements with terrifying precision.

## Statistics

* **Tier:** 2 Behemoth
* **Motives & Tactics:** Protect its territory, feed on large prey, and attack when provoked or during its hunting cycles. The Silverstream Serpent uses the river's currents to its advantage, striking swiftly and retreating back into the depths.
* **HP:** OOOOOOOO (8)
* **Stress:** OOO (3)
* **ATK:** +3
* **Difficulty:** 15
* **Thresholds:** 6/12

## Combat

* **Bite:** Very Close - 1d8 + 3 physical damage. If this attack drops a target to 0 HP, the serpent attempts to drag the target into the water.
* **Tail Whip:** Close - 1d6 + 2 physical damage, and the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
* **Constrict:** Very Close - The serpent attempts to grapple a target, dealing 1d6 + 2 physical damage per turn until the grapple is broken.

## Features

* **Aquatic Ambush:** The Silverstream Serpent can hold its breath for hours and often attacks from beneath the water, surprising its prey. It has advantage on attack rolls when attacking from underwater.
* **Resilient Scales:** The serpent's scales grant it a natural armor, reducing incoming physical damage by 1.
* **Swift Currents:** Once per combat, the serpent can use the river's currents to move rapidly, allowing it to attack twice in one turn.

## Strategy

The Silverstream Serpent is a cunning adversary that relies on the element of surprise and its natural aquatic agility to overpower its victims. It prefers to strike from the depths, where it can easily retreat and hide, making it difficult to engage in prolonged combat. Adventurers will need to be cautious when traveling near or on the Silverstream River, especially during the night when the serpent is most active.

For adventurers looking to engage this monstrous serpent, it's recommended to consult the "Age of Umbra Adversaries" document for detailed combat mechanics and to prepare strategies that leverage the environment and any possible weaknesses of the serpent.
