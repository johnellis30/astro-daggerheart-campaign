# ADVERSARY: Echoing Wraith

**Description:**
A haunting, spectral entity feeding on the party's fears and stress. When the PCs follow the whispers into the desolate terrain of the Atherian Steppes, they are ambushed by Echoing Wraiths, shadowy beings that thrive in this desolate landscape, pulling at memories and emotions. The Wraiths latch onto the deepest fears and regrets of their victims, using them to drive them mad.
