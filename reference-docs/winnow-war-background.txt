Campaign Background - The Winnow War

The Winnow War began three years ago when the mysterious magical phenomenon known as "The Winnow" started appearing across the realm. This supernatural force drains life from the land, leaving barren wastelands in its wake.

Initial reports came from the Atherian Steppes, where entire villages were found empty, their inhabitants vanished without a trace. The Atherian Empire initially dismissed these as bandit raids or natural disasters.

As The Winnow spread, it became clear this was no ordinary threat. The magical energy seems to target areas of strong life force - fertile farmlands, ancient forests, and populated settlements. Areas affected by The Winnow show characteristic signs:

- Soil becomes ash-gray and barren
- Plant life withers and dies within hours  
- Animals flee the area if possible
- Any humanoids caught in the effect vanish completely
- A strange humming sound can be heard at the edges

The Empire has mobilized troops to contain the spread, but conventional weapons and tactics prove ineffective. Magic seems to slow The Winnow's advance but cannot stop it entirely.

Some scholars theorize The Winnow is a weapon created by an enemy nation. Others believe it's a natural magical disaster, similar to how wild magic zones form. A few whisper it might be punishment from the gods themselves.

The war effort has strained the Empire's resources. Refugees flood the remaining safe territories. Supply lines are disrupted. Trust in the Imperial government wavers as they struggle to respond to this unprecedented threat.

Meanwhile, opportunistic bandits and criminals exploit the chaos. Pirates raid supply convoys meant for refugees. Corrupt officials embezzle relief funds. Some settlements have declared independence, no longer trusting Imperial protection.

This is the world the adventurers find themselves in - a realm under siege by an incomprehensible force, where traditional order breaks down and heroes must forge their own path.
